	abstract = {The present work describes the ADEQUATe platform: a framework to monitor the quality of (Governmental) Open Data catalogs, to re-publish improved and linked versions of the datasets and their respective metadata descriptions, and to include the community in the quality improvement process. The information acquired by the linking and (meta)data improvement steps is then integrated in a semantic search engine. In the paper, we first describe the requirements of the platform, which are based on focus group interviews and a web-based survey. Second, we use these requirements to formulate the goals and show the architecture of the overall platform, and third, we showcase the potential and relevance of the platform to resolve the requirements by describing exemplary user journeys exploring the system. The platform is available at: https://www.adequate.at/},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of the paper is to present a big open legal data (BOLD) platform that will enable easy and advanced access to open legal information across the European Union. We envision facilitating public access for all types of users to open legal data accessed and served via a Legal Web platform in a customizable, structured, intuitive and easy-to-handle way. The user-centric suite of services to be offered include: i) research through legal corpora, analyzing the alignment of national legislation with EU legislation, ii) comparing national laws which target the same life events, iii) analyzing the references to European legislation by national laws, iv) analyzing related laws within the same Member State, v) timeline analysis for all legal acts, vi) visualization of the progress and current status of a specific national or European piece of legislation and vii) sentiment analysis towards new legislation. To implement these, the Manylaws platform builds upon data analytics, text mining, semantic analysis and interactive visualization approaches, for multilingual resources, that will allow users to pose advanced queries, upon which the system will semantically correlate them with annotated resources, to allow the user to retrieve relevant and detailed results, visualized in intuitive ways, and thus allowing better understanding of legal information or building innovative data-centric services. The paper thus describes the novel ManyLaws platform architecture and design specification that will drive the implementation and operation of the ManyLaws portal service infrastructure. The ManyLaws architecture and design specification have been devised following co-design paradigms with legal and parliamentary stakeholders, and software engineering practices for elaboration of its components and their connectors.},

	abstract = {The process of policy-modelling, and the overall field of policy-making are complex and put decision-makers in front of great challenges. One of them is present in form of including citizens into the decision-making process. This can be done via various forms of E-Participation, with active/passive citizen-sourcing as one way to tap into current discussions about topics and issues of relevance towards the general public. An increased understanding of feelings behind certain topics and the resulting behavior of citizens can provide great insight for public administrations. Yet at the same time, it is more important than ever to respect the privacy of the citizens, act in a legally compliant way, and therefore foster public trust. While the introduction of anonymization in order to guarantee privacy preservation represents a proper solution towards the challenges stated before, it is still unclear, if and to what extent the anonymization of data will impact current data analytics technologies. Thus, this research paper investigates the impact of anonymization on sentiment analysis of social media, in the context of smart governance. Three anonymization algorithms are tested on Twitter data and the results are analyzed regarding changes within the resulting sentiment. The results reveal that the proposed anonymization approaches indeed have a measurable impact on the sentiment analysis, up to a point, where results become potentially problematic for further use within the policy-modelling domain.},

We begin by exploring the challenges that displaced persons and aid organizations face throughout three key stages of displacement – flight from conflict zones, temporary displacement, and long term integration. On this basis we analyze how the Estonian e-Governance infrastructure can be used in a refugee emergency. We provide a definition of intangible e-Governance infrastructure. We identify the key component of the existing Estonian e-Governance infrastructure as well as the proposed Governmental Cloud and Data Embassy initiatives. We analyze linkages where the utilization of the infrastructure could potentially counter the challenges of displaced persons and aid organizations. To realize these linkages, we propose a policy to make certain refugee-related, otherwise restricted governmental datasets accessible to international aid organizations. Additionally, we introduce a legal framework for the policy, analyze the technological requirements of its implementation, and discuss its communicational and technology export-related implications.},

We first evaluate the applicability of the agenda-setting theory against the theory of policy agenda building to determine the possible alternative directions for constructing a political agenda at the time of elections. Namely, we identify a non-linear interaction between news organizations, politicians, and the general public during the electoral campaign. This interaction, in turn, shapes the dynamic evolution of the public discourse concerning politics, and it is characterized by high sensitivity to initial conditions and non-linearity. Then, we attempt to identify the presence of an evolutionary trajectory of the political discourse in Lower Austria at the time of elections by observing whether, as the time of an election approaches, the interaction between news organizations and politicians flattens and becomes more linear without the news or the politicians causing the agenda of the other to be set accordingly. Finally, we provide a new methodology for identifying the topics contained in such an agenda so that empirical verification of the proposed hypothesis becomes possible.},

There are several factors driving this movement in a government setting, making it difficult to assess the adoption's success. Through a study of billions of rows of GitHub activity data, this research analyzes the production of OSS by administrations in German-speaking countries in detail and analyses the motivating factors and challenges to OSS adoption through a literature review. Similar studies have been conducted in other nations, with somewhat different approaches, foci, and different ways to identify public GitHub users as well as insiders and outsiders of OSS projects. 16 consequences of OSS usage and development are listed in the paper. On GitHub, we found 1021 OSS projects run by public agencies in largly German-speaking nations. We then compiled a list of the most popular projects based on commits and the most active public agencies in terms of projects. The research also finds automatic contributions by bots, which have not been taken into account in the literature so far, and demonstrates highly substantial positive correlations between commits, forks, and stars as proxy for the popularity of these projects. This research introduces a new method for identifying government organizations in OSS platforms and illuminates the possible positive and negative effects of the public sector's release and adoption of open source software.},

This leads to the anticipation that boosting the Data Economy may reveal new issues of contractual interpretation. Interpretation is generally the central question where performance does not reflect the beneficiary's picture of the contract's execution. The focus of this paper is to consider the application of some warranty principles to the trade of data and the associated data quality properties. Difficulties arise because those principles often originate in context of material goods. The main contribution is the identification of some examples for data quality properties, which can be relevant for determining defects of data within the Austrian legal framework.

In this paper the authors study sentiment analysis algorithms to see if they show human bias, by interchanging lists of names associated with gender, race and political orientation in a synthetic neutral template sentence and then observing how the resulting sentiment values change. As a result, the authors find that names as subjects and objects in English language texts alone do not introduce human bias to the sentences' sentiment values. The findings also suggest that pseudonymization might be a better solution to the anonymization of social media postings for data protection compliance purposes than research so far suggested, owing to the general lack of sentiment distortion of the method introduced in this paper.},
