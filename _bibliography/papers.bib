	abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) is extensively utilized in industry and government because it allows for open access to the source code and allows for external involvement in the software development process. There are several factors driving this movement in a government setting, making it difficult to assess the adoption's success. Through a study of billions of rows of GitHub activity data, this research analyzes the production of OSS by administrations in German-speaking countries in detail and analyses the motivating factors and challenges to OSS adoption through a literature review. Similar studies have been conducted in other nations, with somewhat different approaches, foci, and different ways to identify public GitHub users as well as insiders and outsiders of OSS projects. 16 consequences of OSS usage and development are listed in the paper. On GitHub, we found 1021 OSS projects run by public agencies in largly German-speaking nations. We then compiled a list of the most popular projects based on commits and the most active public agencies in terms of projects. The research also finds automatic contributions by bots, which have not been taken into account in the literature so far, and demonstrates highly substantial positive correlations between commits, forks, and stars as proxy for the popularity of these projects. This research introduces a new method for identifying government organizations in OSS platforms and illuminates the possible positive and negative effects of the public sector's release and adoption of open source software.},

	abstract = {Research on novel marketplaces like the Data Market Austria is increasing, along with the importance the European Commission attaches to the development of the European Data Economy. This leads to the anticipation that boosting the Data Economy may reveal new issues of contractual interpretation. Interpretation is generally the central question where performance does not reflect the beneficiary's picture of the contract's execution. The focus of this paper is to consider the application of some warranty principles to the trade of data and the associated data quality properties. Difficulties arise because those principles often originate in context of material goods. The main contribution is the identification of some examples for data quality properties, which can be relevant for determining defects of data within the Austrian legal framework. The paper further aims to stimulate academic discussion on the entanglement of technical and legal competences.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is used in data-driven decision making and in governmental application of algorithms. Along with its many benefits, literature shows that machine learning solutions can introduce human bias to their results that they from training data. In this paper the authors study sentiment analysis algorithms to see if they show human bias, by interchanging lists of names associated with gender, race and political orientation in a synthetic neutral template sentence and then observing how the resulting sentiment values change. As a result, the authors find that names as subjects and objects in English language texts alone do not introduce human bias to the sentences' sentiment values. The findings also suggest that pseudonymization might be a better solution to the anonymization of social media postings for data protection compliance purposes than research so far suggested, owing to the general lack of sentiment distortion of the method introduced in this paper.},
