I work with the [Center for E-Governance](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/business-globalization/departments/e-governance-administration/centers/center-for-e-governance.html)
at the University for Continuing Education Krems, Austria, as a research engineer,
on applied research projects in the fields of e-Governance, legal technologies, natural language processing, and cybersecurity.

On occasion, I also work as a freelance software and data engineering consultant.
