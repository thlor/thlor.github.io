The Data Market Austria (DMA) project worked towards advancing technology foundations for a data market in Austria by

1. using blockchain techniques to allow resilience through a decentralized approach towards provenance, data computation, curation, preservation, and security;
2. developing the technology basis for data and service brokerage, leading to recommendations for bringing together data and services based on user requirements; and 
3. developing processing and analyzing approaches that have acceptable processing speed while fusing multiple data sources.

In DMA, I developed 
- developed tools for the analysis and enhancement of metadata and data quality,
- developed delivery tools for datasets, data streams, accommodating several access models (e.g. time based access, volume based access). 
- developed data harvester from external portals, 
- performed service integration using OpenAPIv3 and Kubernetes, 
- published results in conference proceedings {% cite rinnerbauer_limitations_2018, schlarb_using_2019, ivanschitz_semantic_2018, ivanschitz_data_2018 %}.
